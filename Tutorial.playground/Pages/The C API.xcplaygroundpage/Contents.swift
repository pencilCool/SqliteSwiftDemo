# Getting Started

The first thing to do is set your playground to run manually rather than automatically. This will help ensure that your SQL commands run when you intend them to. At the bottom of the playground click and hold the Play button until the dropdown menu appears. Choose "Manually Run". 

You will also notice a `destroyPart1Database()` call at the top of this page. You can safely ignore this, the database file used is destroyed each time the playground is run to ensure all statements execute successfully as you iterate through the tutorial.

Secondly, this Playground will need to write SQLite database files to your file system. Create the directory `~/Documents/Shared Playground Data/SQLiteTutorial` by running the following command in Terminal.

`mkdir -p ~/Documents/Shared\ Playground\ Data/SQLiteTutorial`
